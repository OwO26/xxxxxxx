          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [Non-residential]<br>
          Redevelopment of site involving erection of five buildings and retention of one building 
          for provision of up to 69,033 sqm (GIA) of Class E(g) space for flexible life science purpose uses; 
          and provision of up to 6,363 sqm (GIA) flexible Class E supporting uses and Class F1 and 
          Class F2 supporting uses (gallery/ exhibition/ community uses); up to 2,820 sqm (GIA) F1(a) for research 
          and development and teaching activities in the life science sector; with associated landscaping; 
          public realm and highway works; re-provision of existing on-street car parking; 
          and erection of a single pavilion building comprising up to 759 sqm (GIA) Class E(b) café use with ancillary storage, 
          and Sui Generis use (public toilets) set within a new landscaped open square. 
          The development is to involve erection of a building up to 4 storeys on Plot A (including top storey plant); 
          and erection of two buildings (on Plots B1 and B3) of 4 storeys rising to 8 storeys respectively 
          (the latter including top storey plant) including the demolition of former Outpatient's Building Annexe 
          and part demolition/part retention of main former Outpatient's Building; 
          and on Plot B2 the retention of the Ambrose King building. The development is to also involve the erection of a 
          7 storey building (including top storey plant) on Plot C (45.9m AOD); 
          and erection of 15 storey building (including 2 top storeys of plant) on Plot D1 (78.7m AOD).<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The application for the redevelopment of the Whitechapel Road Development Site needed to go through a committee due to its scale and complexity. It involved multiple buildings for various uses, including life science purposes, community uses, and a café. The proposal also included amendments to the Section 106 heads of terms, which required careful consideration and legal advice to ensure compliance with planning policies.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The application was approved by the committee with the necessary planning obligations and conditions.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The original plan for the redevelopment of the site included five new buildings and the retention of one building for up to 69,033 sqm 
          of flexible life science space. The new proposal significantly amends this to include up to 6,363 sqm of flexible Class E, F1, and F2 
          supporting uses, and up to 2,820 sqm of F1(a) space for research, development, and teaching in the life science sector. 
          It emphasizes delivering public benefits such as establishing a science cluster for R&D, creating employment and training opportunities, 
          and potentially up to 4,180 FTE jobs. The development also aims to provide new community spaces, including a Community Involvement Centre and a Community Lab. 
          Additionally, the proposal addresses public consultation concerns by improving access to employment and offering a minimum of 20 apprenticeships in the end-use phase.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br> 
          [Non-residential]<br>
          Demolition of 101 Whitechapel High Street, 6 Commercial Street and 
          the western annex of the Canon Barnett Primary School; partial demolition and partial retention of 102 - 105 Whitechapel High Street (with internal alterations) and 2 – 4 Commercial Street (façade retained); and redevelopment to provide buildings ranging from ground plus 17 storeys, comprising office floorspace (Class E(g)), community hall (Class F2); relocation and expansion of the existing schoolplayground and School Annex (Class F1); associated car and cycle parking, hard and soft landscaping and other associated works.<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The site needs to go through a committee because:<br>
          Heritage Impact: It's in a conservation area and near listed buildings.<br>
          Policy Issues: It doesn't comply with several planning policies.<br>
          Public Concerns: There are many objections from the community.<br>
          Balancing Benefits and Harm: The committee must weigh public benefits against potential harm.<br>
          Complexity: The proposal's design and impact require detailed assessment.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          Officer's confirmed that the proposed  scheme is outside of the tall buildings zone, in a conservation area and contravenes policy.<br>
          Councillor Amin Rahman moved and Councillor Shubo Hussain seconded to defer the application for a site visit.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The new plan includes the partial demolition and retention of 102-105 Whitechapel High Street and 2-4 Commercial Street, 
          with internal alterations, and the construction of buildings ranging from ground plus 17 storeys, 
          primarily for office space, a community hall, and the relocation and expansion of the existing school playground and annex. 
          The proposal now includes a taller building of up to 18 storeys for office use, compared to the previously refused proposal of up to 15 storeys, 
          addressing the previous refusal reasons related to scale, massing, and appearance. 
          The extensive demolition within the Whitechapel High Street Conservation Area (WHSCA) and the retention of only the facades of certain buildings are 
          intended to balance the need for new development with the preservation of heritage assets. 
          The inclusion of a community hall and the relocation and expansion of the school playground and annex are 
          intended to provide community benefits and address the loss of existing facilities. 
          The new proposal also aims to mitigate the adverse effects on daylight, sunlight, 
          and overshadowing to residential properties and the school playground, which were significant concerns in the previous refusal.<br><br>

          <strong>Result</strong><br>
          Refused<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          Scale and Impact: Large-scale redevelopment involving demolition and new construction up to 17 storeys.<br>
          Heritage and Conservation: Located in a conservation area near listed buildings, requiring careful assessment.<br>
          Public Consultation: Multiple public representations need to be considered.<br>
          Policy Compliance: Must align with local, regional, and national planning policies.<br>
          Environmental and Social Impact: Includes significant environmental and social considerations.<br>
          Site Visit: Committee members conducted site visits for a thorough assessment.<br><br>
        
          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The site has been refused planning permission for several reasons. 
          Firstly, the proposed development does not represent high-quality or place-sensitive design due to its layout, 
          scale, bulk, height, appearance, and architectural features, failing to integrate positively 
          with the surrounding context. Secondly, it constitutes a tall building outside of a designated Tall Building Zone 
          without justification, failing to meet the criteria for tall buildings and detracting from important landmarks and 
          heritage assets. Thirdly, the development would harm the character and appearance of the Whitechapel High Street Conservation Area 
          and the setting of nearby listed buildings, with the harm not being outweighed by public benefits. 
          Additionally, the proposal would result in unacceptable deterioration in daylight and sunlight levels for neighboring residential developments 
          and Canon Barnett School, as well as causing privacy and overshadowing issues for the school. 
          Lastly, the development would lead to the loss of existing ground floor retail space and education and training facilities, 
          negatively impacting the vitality of the area and failing to provide replacements or demonstrate a lack of need for these facilities. (Copilot)<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The proposed development now includes the demolition of 101 Whitechapel High Street, 6 Commercial Street, 
          and the western annex of Canon Barnett Primary School, with partial demolition and retention of 102-105 Whitechapel High Street and 2-4 Commercial Street. 
          The new plan involves erecting an 18-storey office building, which is taller than the previously refused 15-storey proposal, 
          and includes a community hall and a new playground for the school. These changes were made to address the previous refusal reasons, 
          which cited issues with scale, massing, appearance, and townscape and heritage impact, as well as failure to meet tall buildings policy 
          and concerns about daylight, sunlight, and overshadowing impacts on residential properties and the school playground. 
          The revised plan aims to mitigate these issues by redistributing the building mass and incorporating heritage-led design elements, 
          although it still faces opposition from heritage bodies and local stakeholders.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [921 Student Accommodation]<br>
          Redevelopment of the site to provide purpose built student accommodation 
          with associated amenity space and Class E(a)(b) floorspace within a building of up to 46 storeys with basement; 
          together with plant, car and cycle parking facilities, associated servicing, 
          access and landscaping and all associated ancillary works and structures.<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The application needs to go through the committee because it involves significant changes to 
          the previously approved land use. The applicant wants to change the initial approval for 
          standard housing to student accommodation. This requires committee review due to the scale of the development, 
          compliance with policies, and local impact, including parking and the future of Lovegrove Walk. 
          The proposal also involves transferring floor space from another development, 
          which needs committee consideration.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The result of the meeting was that the planning application for the redevelopment at 7 Brannan Street, 
          London was deferred for a site visit. This decision was made after a vote by the committee members, 
          which resulted in a tie of 4 votes in favor and 4 against, with the Chair's casting vote leading to the deferral.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The original plan for 7 Brannan Street, approved in 2014, was to deliver standard C3 residential accommodation. 
          However, the new proposal aims to introduce 912 Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) 
          bedrooms within a 46-storey tower, which is seen as a positive step towards creating 
          a mixed and balanced community within the Wood Wharf masterplan. 
          The original plan required a minimum of 1,700 homes, but 3,334 homes have already gained detailed consent 
          and are being delivered, meaning the applicant is not obligated to deliver more housing. 
          The new proposal includes 35% affordable rooms, with at least 51% of them subject to a nominations agreement secured via legal obligation. 
          This commitment to affordability was not explicitly detailed in the original plan.<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The Bow Common Gas Works site needs to go through a committee because:<br>
          Significant Changes: The application involves major amendments to a previously approved plan, including changes to building heights, layouts, and residential mix.<br>
          Large-Scale Development: It's a comprehensive mixed-use project with residential, business, retail, and community uses, impacting the local area significantly.<br>
          Public Consultation: Extensive public consultations have been conducted, and the committee reviews community feedback.<br>
          Strategic Importance: The site is crucial for delivering housing and infrastructure as outlined in the Council's Local Plan 2031.<br>
          Environmental and Social Impact: The development's potential impacts on the environment and community need thorough assessment.<br>
          Policy Compliance: The committee ensures the development complies with all relevant planning policies and legal requirements.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The proposed development delivers the requirements of the site allocation policy and is considered to accord with the development plan. 
          Officers are satisfied that the proposed development would deliver a high quality, well integrated, inclusive, sustainable place, 
          which provides a significant contribution to the delivery of the Council's housing targets and identified housing needs.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The amendments include an increase in the quantum of development across the site, a rise in the number of residential homes, 
          and modifications to the landscaping layout. Specifically, the detailed component now includes Block G and renamed Blocks D, E, and F, 
          expanding the detailed component to 1.12 hectares and providing 365 new homes. The proposed development continues to deliver a policy-compliant level of affordable housing, 
          focusing on the early delivery of affordable housing within phase 2. The increase in building heights would impact some neighbouring residential properties, 
          but the benefits of additional housing and early delivery of affordable housing outweigh these impacts. The vehicle and pedestrian/cycle access, 
          accessible car parking arrangements, and on-site servicing are acceptable, subject to conditions and details secured by legal agreement.<br><br>

          Minor Material Amendments to Planning permission Ref: PA/21/00288, Dated 14/07/2022:<br>
          Amendment(s) sought: Amendment to the wording of Condition 22 – Operational Requirements.<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The proposal involved changes to the wording of Condition 22, which included operational requirements related to air quality and noise. These changes required careful consideration to ensure they met legal and planning policy requirements. Additionally, the application was initially deferred for further information to clarify the impact on residents, which necessitated a detailed review by the committee.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          That the Section 73 application for amendments to the existing planning permission at Blackwall Way Yard Jetty be GRANTED subject to:
          <ul>
            <li>Condition 22, as set out in the Committee deferral report.</li>
            <li>A deed of variation securing a planning obligation for air quality and monitoring devices.</li>
            <li>The conditions and informatives set out in the Committee report.</li>
          </ul><br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The original plan included specific operational requirements for the consented riverboat station at the Blackwall Yard site. 
          The new proposal seeks to amend the wording of Condition 22, which sets out these operational requirements. 
          The original condition limited operating hours, the number of clipper movements per hour, and specified engine capacity and emissions standards. 
          The new proposal changes these requirements to allow for average engine emissions at full power, a specified vessel annual average daily traffic flow, 
          and a maximum number of boat movements per hour during nighttime. The new proposal also highlights that the amended wording of Condition 22 is considered acceptable 
          as it would not result in an unacceptable impact on air quality, noise, and general amenity of the area, as well as neighboring residential properties.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [307 Residential unit]<br>
          Demolition of existing buildings and erection of a building up to 35 storeys, comprising residential (Class C3) uses, flexible Community Hub (Class E / F1), landscaping, public realm, plant, cycle storage, servicing and other associated works.<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The site at 2-6 Commercial Street and surrounding areas needs to go through a committee because: <br>
          Scale and Impact: The development involves significant demolition and construction of tall buildings.<br>
          Pubic Interest: There are both support and objections from the public and organizations.<br>
          Policy Compliance: The proposal must be evaluated against various planning policies.<br>
          Environmental Concerns: An Environmental Statement is included, indicating potential significant impacts.<br>
          Detailed Scrutiny: The committee deferred the decision for a site visit, showing the need for thorough review.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The proposal delivers substantial public benefits, aligning with strategic planning objectives and contributing positively to the borough's growth and regeneration. It provides good quality design and delivers several notable public benefits and infrastructure improvements, while delivering much needed affordable housing, particularly for families. Officers therefore recommend the grant of planning permission.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The new proposal for the site at 1 Selsdon Way, London E14 9GL, involves significant changes from the original plan. 
          The site, which is within a designated area for substantial housing growth, currently contains a car park, office space temporarily used by a school, 
          and disused rooftop sports pitches. The new proposal involves demolishing these existing structures to construct a 35-storey residential tower with 307 new homes, 
          35% of which will be affordable, and a community hub. The design includes a four-storey podium and a slender, triangular tower, 
          ensuring the building remains lower than the taller buildings in the Canary Wharf cluster. The changes aim to provide good quality accommodation, 
          address the need for family homes in the affordable rent tenure, and enhance the public realm with landscaping and public spaces.<br><br>

          [2800 Residential unit]<br>
          Removal of existing permanent structures. Alterations to existing landscaping and provision of hard and soft landscaping, 
          public realm improvements, a flexible event space, retail pavilion (use class E) and all associated works and structures. 
          Provision of road amendments to Upper Bank Street and Montgomery Street and pedestrian friendly public realm and layout enhancements to Water Street.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The proposal involved a hybrid planning application, including both full and outline components, for a comprehensive mixed-use development. This included residential units, commercial spaces, public and private open spaces, and various infrastructure improvements.<br>
          The committee's review was necessary to ensure compliance with planning policies, assess the impact on the local community, and address concerns raised during consultations. The application also included amendments to the original planning permission, such as adding more affordable homes, incorporating new fire safety regulations, and improving the overall design of the scheme.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          That planning permission for development at Poplar Gas Holder site be GRANTED, subject to the recommended planning obligations and conditions, listed in the mail and the update report.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The original plan included a comprehensive mixed-use development with up to 2,800 homes, a school, a public park, and commercial and business uses over seven phases. 
          The new proposal seeks to replace phases 2 and 3 with an alternative scheme that allows for a maximum of 100 additional units compared to the original plan. 
          These units would be designed to a high standard, with good levels of light, outdoor space, and play facilities. 
          The proposal emphasizes delivering family-sized homes in the affordable rent tenure, exceeding planning policy requirements. 
          It also highlights the design, layout, and access arrangements, which integrate well with the existing planning permission for the former gasworks site, 
          optimising the site's potential for large-scale redevelopment.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [Non-residential]<br>
          Removal of existing permanent structures. Alterations to existing landscaping and provision of hard and soft landscaping, public realm improvements, a flexible event space, retail pavilion (use class E) and all associated works and structures. Provision of road amendments to Upper Bank Street and Montgomery Street and pedestrian friendly public realm and layout enhancements to Water Street<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The site went through a committee because:<br>
          Complexity: Significant changes to structures and landscaping.<br>
          Public Input: Ensuring local residents' views are considered.<br>
          Expert Review: Detailed evaluation by planning officers.<br>
          Transparency: Open and fair decision-making process.<br>
          Conditions: Imposing necessary conditions and obligations.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The level of public engagement was consistent with council policy, which is above statutory guidelines. They also mentioned that only one representation from residents was received before the committee meeting. The committee was pleased with the changes made to the application and voted unanimously to grant planning permission with conditions and obligations.(Copilot)<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The initial proposal included the complete closure of Water Street to public-through traffic, which was met with objections due to its potential adverse effects on local businesses, 
          traffic congestion, and residents' access to Wood Wharf. In response, the new proposal allows public vehicles to travel in a west-to-east direction 
          on Water Street and ensures that the closure only occurs when all vehicular entrances/exits to/from Wood Wharf are open to the public. 
          This amendment aims to balance the need for public realm improvements with the practical requirements of traffic flow and access for residents and businesses.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [Non-residential]<br>
          Change of use from Use Class E(g)(i) (Office) to Flexible Use Class F1 (Learning and Non-Residential Institution) / Use Class E (g)(i) (Office)<br><br>

          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The case needed to go through a committee because it proposed changing the use of office space to educational use in a key office area. This change would result in losing 4,138 square meters of office space, which is usually not supported. However, the committee found it acceptable because it wouldn't harm the office space supply in Canary Wharf. The educational use also fits the area's expected uses.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          The committee considered it acceptable in this specific instance as it would not undermine the supply of office space within the Canary Wharf PPOL<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The original plan designated levels 48 and 49 for office use (Class E(g)(i)), but the new proposal changes this to a flexible use that includes both education (Class F1) and office use. 
          This change results in a net loss of 4,138sqm of office floorspace, which is considered acceptable in this specific instance 
          as it does not undermine the supply of office space within the Canary Wharf Primary Preferred Office Location (PPOL). 
          Additionally, the new proposal highlights the strategic importance of the educational use within the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) 
          and Metropolitan Town Centre, aligning with the strategic functions of the CAZ, which include centers of excellence for higher education and research.<br><br>

          <strong>Site Description</strong><br>
          [530 Residential unit - Proposing 116 affordable]<br>
          Part retention and part demolition of the existing boundary walls and the former tram shed depot arches, and retention of the three storey office building. Demolition of the remainder of the existing warehouse and the redevelopment of the site to provide 530 residential units (Class C3), 2644sqm (GIA) of workspace (Classes B1a, B1b, or B1c), 508sqm (GIA) of flexible retail; professional services; and restaurant/bar uses (Classes A1, A2, A3, A4), within buildings ranging from 3 storeys (20.2m AOD) to 20 storeys (72.7m AOD), with associated parking, landscaping, public realm and all associated works.<br><br>
  
          <strong>Reason</strong><br>
          The application needed to go through a committee due to significant changes in the project. These changes included adjustments to the affordable housing tenure and mix, removal of shared ownership properties, and an increase in affordable rent units and family-sized homes. The modifications were necessary due to economic challenges, material shortages, a housing provider withdrawing, and new fire safety regulations.<br><br>

          <strong>Planner Comment</strong><br>
          Upon a vote of 7 for and 1 against, the Officers recommendations as set out in the main report to modify the S106 agreement dated 09/10/2020 was agreed.<br><br>

          <strong>Result Summary</strong><br>
          The new proposal focuses on modifying the affordable housing offer due to market conditions, build cost inflation, interest rates, and regulatory changes. 
          The revised affordable housing offer removes the Shared Ownership component and increases the number of Affordable Rent homes, 
          particularly family-sized units. This change results in a reduction of the overall percentage of affordable homes from 35% to 21.9% 
          when measured on a habitable room basis. The new proposal also highlights the importance of delivering genuinely affordable housing, 
          such as affordable rent, to address local housing needs and overcrowding issues in the borough. 
          The revised tenure mix prioritizes affordable rent housing, which is considered more viable and necessary for the local community.<br><br>
